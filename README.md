			 * 2. This system is designed to register, search, delete and display all the patient records.
			 * 3. Each patient has got an autogenerated Patient ID.
			 * 4. In the given program, we use modular approach to manage our patient record using linked lists.
			 * 5. The following are the user defined functions used here: registration()-to register the new patient record, search()-to search and display  
			 *    the given patient record, delete()-to delete the given record.
			 * 6. The advantages of this system is that it helps to reduce the paperwork for managing the patient record as well as provides easy
			      accessibility to any record.
			 * 7. The interface is designed to be user friendly.
			 * 8. When hospital's use this system they can save the details of the patient's more securely than it is done manually.
